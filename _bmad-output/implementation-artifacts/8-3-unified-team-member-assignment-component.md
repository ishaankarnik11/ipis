# Story 8.3: Unified Team Member Assignment Component

Status: ready-for-dev

<!-- Note: Validation is optional. Run validate-create-story for quality check before dev-story. -->

## Story

As a Delivery Manager,
I want to assign team members (employee + role + selling rate) to my project during creation or at any time after approval, using a single consistent interface, so that project setup is fast, complete, and uses standardised data.

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

1. **Given** the project creation form (`CreateEditProject.tsx`),
   **When** the form renders,
   **Then** a "Team Members" section is present below the project fields, containing a repeatable row component: searchable employee dropdown, role dropdown (active `ProjectRole` entries), selling rate numeric input with "₹/hr" label, [+ Add Row] and [✕ Remove] buttons.

2. **Given** the employee search dropdown in a team member row,
   **When** the user types 2+ characters,
   **Then** it queries `GET /api/v1/employees?search=<term>&status=active` and displays matching results showing: employee name, designation, and department — all active employees across the entire organisation regardless of department (FR57).

3. **Given** the employee search endpoint,
   **When** the query is called,
   **Then** it returns employees matching by name (case-insensitive partial match), excluding resigned employees (`is_resigned = false`), with no department filter — the existing `getAll` or a new search variant is used.

4. **Given** the role dropdown in a team member row,
   **When** the dropdown opens,
   **Then** it shows only active `ProjectRole` entries fetched via `GET /api/v1/project-roles?active=true`, displaying the role name.

5. **Given** a T&M project creation form with one or more team member rows,
   **When** the user attempts to submit without a selling rate on any member row,
   **Then** client-side validation highlights the selling rate field with error: "Selling rate is required for T&M projects" — form submission is blocked.

6. **Given** a non-T&M project (Fixed Cost, AMC, Infrastructure) creation form,
   **When** team members are added,
   **Then** the selling rate field is visible but not required — it accepts an optional value or can be left blank.

7. **Given** the project creation API `POST /api/v1/projects`,
   **When** called with a `members[]` array in the payload (e.g., `{ ...projectFields, members: [{ employeeId, roleId, billingRatePaise }] }`),
   **Then** the project and all team member assignments are created atomically in a single `prisma.$transaction` — if any member assignment fails (e.g., duplicate employee, resigned employee, inactive role), the entire creation rolls back and returns the specific error.

8. **Given** the project creation API with `members[]`,
   **When** called without `members[]` or with an empty array,
   **Then** the project is created successfully with no team members — members are optional at creation time.

9. **Given** the project detail page (`ProjectDetail.tsx`) for an ACTIVE project,
   **When** a Delivery Manager or Admin clicks "Add Team Member",
   **Then** a modal opens containing the same team member row component (employee search + role dropdown + selling rate). On save, `POST /api/v1/projects/:id/team-members` is called with `{ employeeId, roleId, billingRatePaise }`.

10. **Given** the existing `AddTeamMemberModal` component,
    **When** this story is complete,
    **Then** the modal is refactored to use the new `TeamMemberRow` component internally — reusing the same employee search, role dropdown, and selling rate input.

11. **Given** the `createProjectSchema` in `shared/schemas/project.schema.ts`,
    **When** updated for this story,
    **Then** each engagement model variant includes an optional `members` array: `members: z.array(z.object({ employeeId: z.string().uuid(), roleId: z.string().uuid(), billingRatePaise: z.number().int().positive().optional() })).optional()`.

12. **Given** `team-member-assignment.test.tsx`,
    **When** `pnpm test` runs,
    **Then** tests cover: employee search shows results from all departments, role dropdown shows only active roles, T&M selling rate required validation, non-T&M selling rate optional, add/remove row, project creation payload includes members array, modal reuse on project detail.

## E2E Test Scenarios

### Positive

- E2E-P1: DM creates T&M project with 2 team members (employee + role + selling rate each) → project created, navigates to detail, both members visible in roster (AC: 1, 5, 7)
- E2E-P2: DM creates Fixed Cost project with 1 team member without selling rate → project created successfully, member visible in roster with no selling rate (AC: 6, 8)
- E2E-P3: DM creates project with no team members → project created successfully with empty roster (AC: 8)
- E2E-P4: DM on ACTIVE project clicks Add Team Member → modal opens, searches employee from different department, selects role, enters rate, saves → member appears in roster (AC: 2, 9)
- E2E-P5: Employee search returns results from multiple departments → dropdown shows name, designation, department for disambiguation (AC: 2, 3)
- E2E-P6: Role dropdown shows only active roles, deactivated role from 8.1 tests is absent (AC: 4)

### Negative

- E2E-N1: DM creates T&M project with team member missing selling rate → validation error shown, form does not submit (AC: 5)
- E2E-N2: DM adds team member who is already on the project → API returns 409 "Employee is already assigned to this project" (AC: 7)
- E2E-N3: DM adds resigned employee → API returns 400 "Cannot assign a resigned employee to a project" (AC: 7)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Constraints (MUST follow)

1. **Atomic creation**: Project + members in single `prisma.$transaction`. If member assignment fails, project creation rolls back entirely. User gets a specific error (which employee/role failed and why).
2. **Employee search — org-wide**: No `departmentId` filter. The dropdown must show employees from ALL departments. Display department name in dropdown option for disambiguation.
3. **Debounced search**: 300ms debounce on employee search to avoid excessive API calls. Minimum 2 characters before triggering search.
4. **Reusable component**: `TeamMemberRow` must be reusable in both project creation (multi-row) and the add member modal (single-row). The component is controlled — parent manages state.
5. **Engagement model awareness**: `TeamMemberRow` receives `engagementModel` prop. T&M → selling rate required. Others → optional. This validation is both client-side (immediate feedback) and server-side (API enforcement).
6. **Currency in paise**: Selling rate input is in rupees (user-facing), converted to paise before API submission: `billingRatePaise = inputValue * 100`. Display uses `formatCurrency()`.
7. **Schema backward compatibility**: The `members[]` array in `createProjectSchema` is optional to maintain backward compatibility — projects can still be created without members.

### Previous Story Intelligence

- **From 3.2:** `addTeamMember` service function validates T&M billing rate requirement, employee existence, resigned status, and duplicate assignment. Reuse this validation logic in the transactional create path.
- **From 3.3:** `CreateEditProject.tsx` uses React Hook Form with engagement-model-specific fields. Team member section should integrate with the same form or manage its own state and merge at submit time.
- **From 3.4:** `AddTeamMemberModal` currently has employee ID text input and free-text role. Refactor to use `TeamMemberRow` component for consistency.
- **From 8.1:** `roleId` replaces `role` string. Employee search dropdown replaces manual employeeId entry.
- **From 8.2:** `project-roles.api.ts` provides `getProjectRoles(activeOnly)` for the role dropdown data source.

### Gotchas & Go/No-Go

- **Employee search performance**: With 500+ employees, the search must be server-side (not client-side filter). Use `ILIKE` with limit 20.
- **Selling rate UX**: User enters in rupees (e.g., `2500`), system stores as paise (`250000`). The conversion `× 100` happens in the API service layer before submission. When displaying, `formatCurrency()` converts back.
- **Duplicate detection in members array**: If the same `employeeId` appears twice in the `members[]` array at creation, the API should reject with a clear error before attempting DB insert.
- **Engagement model change**: If user changes engagement model after adding team members, the T&M selling rate validation must re-evaluate. Switching from T&M to Fixed Cost should not block submission if rates are missing.
