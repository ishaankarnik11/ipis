# Story 6.4: Ledger Drawer — UI Component

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a Finance, Delivery Manager, or Admin user,
I want to click any project row and see a detailed Ledger Drawer that shows exactly how the margin figure was calculated — with every employee's hours and cost contribution visible,
so that I can trust the numbers and investigate any unexpected result without leaving the dashboard.

## Acceptance Criteria (AC)

1. **Given** any project row in the dashboard,
   **When** the user clicks it,
   **Then** an antd v6 `Drawer` component opens from the right side at 480px width with the project name and data period in the drawer title — this is "The Ledger" (FR35).

2. **Given** the Drawer opens,
   **When** the `GET /api/v1/reports/projects/:id/ledger` API call resolves,
   **Then** the drawer renders within 1.5 seconds total (network + render) showing: Revenue, Cost, Profit, Margin % KPI tiles at the top; an employee cost breakdown table below.

3. **Given** the employee breakdown table,
   **When** it renders,
   **Then** columns are: Employee Name, Designation, Hours, Cost/Hour (₹), Contribution (₹); all monetary cells use `font-feature-settings: 'tnum'` (tabular numerals) for column alignment.

4. **Given** any figure in the Ledger that is derived (not a raw input),
   **When** rendered,
   **Then** it has a dotted underline (`border-bottom: 1px dotted`); hovering over it shows a tooltip with the formula used to calculate it (e.g., "Annual CTC (₹X) + ₹1,80,000 overhead ÷ 12 ÷ 160 hours").

5. **Given** any employee row where `contribution_paise` is the largest single contributor to a loss,
   **When** the project is in loss (`profit_paise < 0`),
   **Then** that row's background is `#FFF2F0` — consistent with the loss-row convention.

6. **Given** the `engine_version` and `calculated_at` fields in the snapshot,
   **When** rendered at the bottom of the Drawer,
   **Then** a metadata footer shows "Calculated: [relative timestamp] · Engine v[version]" so users can identify stale data.

7. **Given** the Drawer on mobile viewports,
   **When** the screen width is < 768px,
   **Then** the Drawer renders at 100% width (full-screen overlay) instead of 480px.

8. **Given** the Drawer is open and the user presses Escape or clicks the backdrop,
   **When** the close event fires,
   **Then** the Drawer closes and the TanStack Query cache entry for that ledger remains warm (no refetch on reopen within 5 minutes).

9. **Given** `ledger-drawer.test.tsx`,
   **When** `pnpm test` runs,
   **Then** tests cover: drawer open on row click, API call with correct project ID and period, dotted underline on derived figures, loss-row background, metadata footer content, mobile width override, Escape/backdrop close.

## E2E Test Scenarios

### Positive

- E2E-P1: Finance user clicks a project row on the dashboard → Ledger Drawer opens from right with project name and period in title (AC: 1)
- E2E-P2: Drawer shows Revenue, Cost, Profit, Margin % KPI tiles at top and employee breakdown table below with correct columns (Name, Designation, Hours, Cost/Hour, Contribution) (AC: 2, 3)
- E2E-P3: Derived figures (Cost/Hour, Margin %) have dotted underline; hovering shows formula tooltip (AC: 4)
- E2E-P4: Loss project ledger — largest contributor row has `#FFF2F0` background (AC: 5)
- E2E-P5: Metadata footer shows "Calculated: [relative time] · Engine v[version]" (AC: 6)
- E2E-P6: User presses Escape → Drawer closes; reopening same project does not trigger new API call (cache warm) (AC: 8)

### Negative

- E2E-N1: HR user clicks project row on dashboard — Ledger Drawer does not open (HR has no dashboard access)
- E2E-N2: Ledger API returns error → Drawer shows inline error message, no crash

  - [ ] 9.5 All existing + new E2E tests pass

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Constraints (MUST follow)

1. **Drawer state in parent**: `useState` in `ProjectDashboard.tsx` — no global state, no Redux, no context.
2. **TanStack Query for data**: `useQuery(['ledger', projectId, period])` with `staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000`. Never recalculates — reads snapshot only.
3. **No inline styles for tabular numerals**: Use CSS class with `font-feature-settings: 'tnum'`.
4. **Currency formatting in frontend**: API returns paise. `formatCurrency()` in rendering.
5. **Loss-row convention**: `#FFF2F0` background — same convention used across all dashboards.
6. **480px desktop, 100% mobile**: antd `Drawer` `width` prop — use `window.innerWidth < 768 ? '100%' : 480`.

### Existing Code to Reuse (DO NOT recreate)

| What | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ledger API endpoint | `routes/ledger.routes.ts` | Story 6.3 — backend exists |
| formatCurrency | `shared/utils/currency.ts` | Story 1.1 |
| formatPercent | `shared/utils/percent.ts` | Story 1.1 |
| ProjectDashboard | `pages/dashboards/ProjectDashboard.tsx` | Story 6.1 — add drawer trigger |
| MarginHealthBadge | `components/MarginHealthBadge.tsx` | Story 6.1 — may reuse in drawer |

### New Dependencies Required

None — antd Drawer, Tooltip, Table already available.

### Previous Story Intelligence

- **From 6.3:** `GET /api/v1/reports/projects/:id/ledger?period=YYYY-MM` returns `breakdown_json` with full decomposed inputs. Response shape documented in Story 6.3.
- **From 6.1:** `ProjectDashboard.tsx` renders the project table. Add onClick to rows to open the Ledger Drawer.
- **From 4.5:** `breakdown_json` contains `inputs: [{ employeeId, employeeName, designation, hours, cost_per_hour_paise, contribution_paise }]` — this populates the employee breakdown table.
